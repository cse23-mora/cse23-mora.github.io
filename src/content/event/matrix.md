# 💡🐍 Snake Game Like You've Never Seen Before! 🎮  
### A Unique CSE Hour Workshop – Lighting Up Creativity  

Ever wondered what happens when you mix **code**, **creativity**, and **961 tiny light bulbs**? Our fellow batchmates have brought the classic **Snake Game** to life — not on a screen, but on a **31x31 LED bulb matrix**! 🔥

This isn’t just a game — it’s a **living, glowing grid** where each bulb acts like a pixel, and every movement of the snake is powered by smart **C++ logic and precision wiring**. It’s retro gaming, reimagined with hardware and passion.

## 🔧 What to Expect from the Workshop  

Join us for **The CSE Hour**, a special session conducted by **Tharaka Jayasena**, where we take a deep dive into how these glowing games came to life.

### 🎮 Games Featured:
- 🐍 **Snake**
- 🚀 **Galaxys**
- 🧱 **Tetris**

### 💡 Topics Covered:
- How the **LED wall** works
- Game logic and rendering on a **31x31 matrix**
- Integrating hardware with **ESP32**
- Challenges faced and clever hacks
- How to expand and **contribute** to the project

> **P.S.** This is an **open-source** initiative! We’re hoping to see **more games and features** added by YOU.

## 📍 Event Details:
