  <p>👩‍💻👨‍💻 We are the <strong>CSE Batch of 2023</strong> — a vibrant blend of curious minds, problem solvers, creative thinkers, and yes… the occasional caffeine-fueled night owl — all brought together at the <strong>University of Moratuwa</strong>.</p>

  <p>Our journey began with a simple <code>"Hello, World"</code>, but what followed was anything but ordinary. From sleepless hackathons and heated whiteboard debates to the quiet joy of solving that one impossible bug — we've shared a thousand little moments that shaped us, not just as engineers, but as friends, dreamers, and a family.</p>

  <p>This website is more than just a project. It’s our <em>digital home</em> — thoughtfully designed and lovingly built by our own hands — to capture the spirit of our batch, our growth, and the memories we carry forward.</p>

  <p>It’s where <strong>code meets creativity</strong>, and behind every feature lies a story, a late-night laugh, or a lesson learned.</p>

  <p>Here, you'll find our milestones, our creations, and a glimpse into the community we've built together — one line of code and one moment at a time.</p>

  <p>So, whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast, a future CSE student, or simply someone who wandered in with curiosity — <strong>welcome</strong>. You're part of our story now. 🩷</p>
